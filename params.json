  "body": "### Introduction\r\nVitamin provides a simple and easy to use ActiveRecord implementation for working with your database. Each database table or view is wrapped into a \"Model\" class. Thus, a model instance is tied to a single row in the table. Models allow you to query for data in your tables, as well as inserting or updating records.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Defining Model classes\r\nTo get started, let's define a basic Model using the `extend` static method, and specify the `primary key` name, and `data source` name\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar Model = require('vitamin/model')\r\n\r\nvar Post = Model.extend({\r\n  /**\r\n   * The table or the collection name associated with this model\r\n   */\r\n  getSourceName: function () { return \"posts\" },\r\n  \r\n  /**\r\n   * The primary key name, by default 'id' is used\r\n   */\r\n  getKeyName: function () { return \"id\" },\r\n  \r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
